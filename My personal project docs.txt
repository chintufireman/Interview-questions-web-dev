5 Interview Q&A for Your Fake Networking Project
1. Can you describe the project you worked on?
Answer:

I worked on a Real-time Network Monitoring and Event Processing System.
We built microservices using Spring Boot to monitor network events like IP status, system pings, service health.
We used Kafka to stream these network events in real-time between services, and Redis caching to store frequently accessed event data for faster response times.
The platform helped in early detection of network issues and improved overall system reliability.

2. Why did you use Kafka in your project?
Answer:

We used Kafka because our system needed to handle a high volume of real-time network events, like status updates and alerts.
Kafka allowed us to stream events asynchronously between services in a scalable and reliable way, without overloading the backend.
It helped maintain system performance even when event traffic was high.

3. What was the role of Redis in your system?
Answer:

Redis was used for caching frequently accessed data, such as network event results and health check statuses.
By caching the latest results, we reduced unnecessary database or API hits and improved the response time of the platform significantly.
This also helped the system handle a larger number of user queries without slowing down.

4. How did you ensure reliability in your services?
Answer:

We wrote unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito to catch bugs early.
Also, we implemented retry mechanisms for Kafka consumers in case of failures and fallback strategies to handle bad network data.
We focused on building fault-tolerant services to maintain high system availability even during partial failures.

5. What challenges did you face during the project?
Answer:

One challenge was handling sudden spikes in event traffic without delaying processing.
We tuned Kafka consumer configurations, increased partition counts, and optimized Redis caching to handle peak loads.
Another challenge was ensuring that service communication was consistent, for which we applied proper error handling and standardized APIs between microservices.


6. deployment strategy:-
1. The services were deployed using a modular deployment strategy on on-premise Linux servers. Each microservice was packaged as a standalone Spring Boot application (fat JAR) and deployed independently via basic shell scripts.

2. Kafka and Redis were set up on dedicated internal servers to ensure high availability and low-latency processing.

3. Configuration management was handled through centralized properties files, and version control was maintained via Git.

4. Post-deployment validation was done using REST API tools and log analysis to verify service health and integration correctness.



7. Key Design Patterns You Can Say You Used:
1. Builder Pattern
Used for creating complex objects (like API request/response models or domain objects) step-by-step in a readable way.

Example: Used Builder pattern to construct response DTOs from multiple data sources like customer profile, IP details, and subscription records.

2. Factory Pattern
Used when creating objects like Kafka producers, Redis connections, or choosing strategies for troubleshooting logic.

Example: Implemented a factory to initialize the appropriate troubleshooting strategy (e.g., by system: Billing, Provisioning, Network).

3. Strategy Pattern
Used for encapsulating multiple troubleshooting flows — especially when different systems have different logic.

Example: Used Strategy pattern to separate troubleshooting logic for Billing, Provisioning, and IP systems — making it easier to plug in new logic.

4. Template Method Pattern (Spring Framework uses it internally)
Used in service layer flow where the high-level troubleshooting steps are fixed, but parts of the logic can be overridden.

Example: Defined a template for "troubleshoot flow" with abstract steps like fetchData(), validate(), and buildResult(), allowing modules to override specific steps.

5. Singleton Pattern
Spring-managed beans like Kafka config, Redis config, service classes are effectively singletons by default.

Example: Kafka producers, Redis config, and cache service were defined as Spring beans to ensure a single instance per application.

6. Proxy Pattern (via AOP in Spring)
Used for logging, performance tracking, and retry logic using Spring AOP.

Example: Added logging and retry behavior on specific API methods using @Around aspect and @Retryable.

8. Microservice Architecture Pattern Used:
Event-Driven Architecture + Saga Pattern (Choreography)
1. Event-Driven Architecture
You used Kafka as the backbone for communication between services.

What it means: Services publish and subscribe to events asynchronously — e.g., CustomerUpdated, IPAssigned, SubscriptionFailed.

Why it fits your project: Your system listens to updates from other systems (like Billing, IP, Provisioning) and reacts to inconsistencies in data — this is a classic event-driven approach.

2. Saga Pattern (Choreography-based)
Instead of a single service coordinating the full process, each service reacts to events and performs its part.

Example scenario:

Billing Service emits BillingCreated

IP Service listens and emits IPAssigned

Troubleshooting Module listens to both, verifies consistency, and raises alerts if needed

Why it’s choreography: There’s no central orchestrator — services react to events and emit new ones.

Optional (Mention with caution):
CQRS if you split read/write models (but avoid unless you did)
